# Chat Application
I built this Chat App  from scratch, using ReactJS
You can log in with an user and all the messages will be saved in the database of React.
I used Axios for the Rest API

#### The frameworks and technologies that I learned from this project:
- react-chat-engine
- axios
- react props
- useState and useEffect Hooks
- Using react state hooks
- Login authentication using local storage.
